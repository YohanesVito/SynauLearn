🟦 Tier 1 — Introduction to Web3 & Blockchain
📘 Materials
What is Web3?
 Web3 is the next generation of the internet where users truly own their data, identity, and digital assets.
 Unlike Web2, which is controlled by centralized platforms like Google or Meta, Web3 uses blockchain to ensure transparency and freedom.
 The goal is to create a user-owned internet that’s open, decentralized, and community-driven.


What is Blockchain?
 Blockchain is a distributed database where information is stored in linked blocks that can’t be altered once recorded.
 Each block contains verified transactions, secured through cryptography and maintained by a network of nodes.
 This makes blockchain transparent, tamper-proof, and trustless—no single authority controls it.


Why is Web3 important?
 Web3 shifts power from centralized entities to users by enabling ownership and peer-to-peer interaction.
 It opens new possibilities like DAOs, NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi).
 In Web3, you are not the product—you are the owner of your data and digital value.


Examples of Web3 Applications (dApps)
 Decentralized applications (dApps) run on blockchain networks without central servers or intermediaries.
 Examples include OpenSea (NFT marketplace), Uniswap (DeFi exchange), and Lens Protocol (Web3 social platform).
 All activity on dApps is public, verifiable, and controlled by users, not companies.

🟩 Tier 2 — Wallets, Safety & Best Practices
📘 Materials
What is a Web3 Wallet?
 A Web3 wallet is a digital tool used to store, send, and receive crypto assets like tokens and NFTs.
 It also acts as your “login” for decentralized applications.
 Popular wallets include MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet.


Private Keys & Seed Phrases
 A private key is a secret code that proves ownership of your blockchain assets.
 A seed phrase is a list of 12–24 words used to recover your wallet.
 Anyone with your seed phrase can access all your funds—never share it with anyone.


Wallet Drains & Scams
 A wallet drain happens when you unknowingly give malicious access to your wallet.
 Scams often use fake links, phishing sites, or deceptive pop-ups to trick you into signing harmful transactions.
 Once permission is granted, attackers can transfer all your assets without notice.


How to Prevent Wallet Drains
 Never sign or approve transactions from unknown or suspicious websites.
 Use hardware wallets for extra security and separate wallets for storage and daily use.
 Regularly review app permissions using tools like revoke.cash.

🟥 Tier 3 — DeFi, NFTs, & Onchain Identity
📘 Materials
What is DeFi (Decentralized Finance)?
 DeFi is a financial system that operates entirely on blockchain—without banks or intermediaries.
 Users can lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest directly through smart contracts.
 Examples include Aave, Compound, and Uniswap.


NFTs and Their Use Cases
 NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital assets that cannot be replaced or duplicated.
 They’re often used for digital art, certificates, event tickets, and onchain identity.
 NFT ownership is publicly verifiable and permanently recorded on blockchain.


Onchain Identity
 Onchain identity represents your digital reputation and activities on the blockchain.
 It may include transaction history, NFT ownership, or participation in DAOs.
 This identity can be used across multiple apps without sharing private data.


Interacting with dApps
 Connecting your wallet to a dApp is like logging in without a username or password.
 The dApp reads your wallet’s public data to identify you while you retain full control.
 Always verify the app’s authenticity before granting any permissions.
